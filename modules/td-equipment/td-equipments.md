## Routes
The module defines several routes for managing equipment and services. These routes are protected by middleware to ensure only authorized users can access them.

```php
// filepath: /var/Projects/TaskHub/Dev/modules/td-equipment/src/Routes/web.php
Route::middleware(['web', 'auth'])->group(function () {
    // Equipment routes
    Route::resource('equipment', EquipmentController::class)->except(['edit', 'update']);
    Route::get('equipment/{equipment}/edit', [EquipmentController::class, 'edit'])->name('equipment.edit');
    Route::put('equipment/{equipment}/update', [EquipmentController::class, 'update'])->name('equipment.update');

    // Service routes
    Route::resource('equipment.service', ServiceController::class)->only(['create', 'store', 'destroy']);

    // Widget routes
    Route::get('/widgets/equipments-list', [WidgetController::class, 'equipmentsListWidget'])->name('widgets.equipmentsListWidget');
});
```

## Views
The module includes several Blade views for displaying equipment and service information.

### Equipment Views
- **index.blade.php**: Lists all equipment.
- **show.blade.php**: Displays details of a specific equipment item.
- **create.blade.php**: Form to create new equipment.
- **edit.blade.php**: Form to edit existing equipment.

### Widget Views
- **equipmentsListWidget.blade.php**: Displays equipment certification statuses.

## Widget Setup
To display the equipment certification widget on the dashboard, follow these steps:
1. Ensure the widget is registered in the `widgets` table.
2. Assign the widget to the desired route in the `widget_positions` table.

Example migration to insert widget data:
```php
// filepath: /var/Projects/TaskHub/Dev/modules/td-equipment/database/migrations/2025_03_01_100007_insert_widget_row.php
public function up()
{
    $widgetId = DB::table('widgets')->insertGetId([
        'name' => 'Equipments List Widget',
        'description' => 'This widget displays a list of equipments.',
        'view_path' => 'widgets::equipmentsListWidget',
        'module' => 'td-equipment',
        'controller' => 'TronderData\Equipment\Http\Controllers\WidgetController@equipmentsListWidget',
        'created_at' => now(),
        'updated_at' => now(),
    ]);

    DB::table('widget_positions')->insert([
        'route' => 'dashboard',
        'name' => 'main',
        'widget_id' => $widgetId,
        'created_at' => now(),
        'updated_at' => now(),
    ]);
}
```
