Credential Bank Module

Thank you ChatGPT for rewriting my original readme for better flow and readability.

This module functions as a "Bank" for user credentials, ensuring that sensitive information is securely stored and encrypted.
Features

    Automatic Encryption & Decryption
        Credentials are encrypted upon storage and automatically decrypted per user when retrieved.
        As operators, we cannot view stored credentialsâ€”only the user can after decryption.
    Optional Individual Encryption Key
        Users can download an individual key file (.txt) for additional security.
        This key must be provided for decryption before data re-enters the standard workflow.
        Future updates will include re-encrypting with a separate personal key.

Installation & Setup

To set up the module, follow these standard Laravel steps:

    Install Dependencies & Migrate Database:

composer install
php artisan migrate

Generate the Encryption Key:

php artisan key:generate

    This command is required for encryption/decryption to function.
    Important: Do not change this key after encrypting data, or decryption will fail.

Clear Configuration Cache (Recommended):

    php artisan config:clear

Encryption Details

    The module uses AES encryption to securely store credentials.
    Encrypted data is hashed before being stored on the server.
    Individual keys (if enabled) use Base64 encoding for transferability.

Known Issues & To-Do List
Current Bugs:

    Edit Key Functionality: The "Edit Key" option does nothing currently.

Planned Features (To-Do List):

    Batch Encryption & Decryption
    Fix Edit Key Functionality
    Allow Re-Encryption with a Separate Personal Key
    Improve UI for Enhanced User Experience
    Logging & Audit Trail for Encryption Events (Optional Security Feature)

Notes & Warnings

    Losing an individual encryption key will make decryption impossible.
    Users must store their key file safely.
    Never change APP_KEY after data is encrypted.
    Doing so will break decryption unless the database is migrated accordingly.
